# Casino Guessing Game

## Overview

Welcome to a simple casino game made in C++! You start with some money and try to guess a number between 1 and 50.  
If you guess correctly, you win double your bet! If not, you lose the money you bet.  
You can keep playing until you run out of money or decide to stop.

## How to Play

2. Each round:
   - You guess a number between 1 and 50.
   - You enter how much money you want to bet.
3. The game picks a random winning number between 1 and 50.
4. If your guess is correct, you win double your bet.
5. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet.
6. If you still have money, you can choose to play again or stop.
7. If you run out of money, the game ends.
